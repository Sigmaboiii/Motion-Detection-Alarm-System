# Motion-Detection-Alarm-System
- This is a motion detection system made in python!!
- I got the inspiration to make this project because this project doesnt need any type of money to spend for or anything and is very cost-effective.

# Libraries used in this project: 

1. opencv-python
2. requests
3. simpleaudio

# What does this code actually do??:

- After running the 'motion_detector.py', there will be a 10 second delay as the webcam is warming up to avoid lag issues.
- It will play a sound once a motion is detected and also it will send
